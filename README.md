# NLP-SUBWORDS
In this Notebook , we break down our text into subwords and check how it impacts our Model
This Model requires a Tensor Flow environment of 2.0 or higher
The embedding Projector fails to visualize text due the ERROR " Number of tensors (999) do not match the number of lines in metadata (992)"
